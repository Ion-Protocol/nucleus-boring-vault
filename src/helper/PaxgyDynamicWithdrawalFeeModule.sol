/**
 * @title PaxgyDynamicWithdrawalFeeModule
 * @notice Withdraw fee module that values PAXG asymmetrically at the vault boundary so that any PAXG:XAU
 * pricing error favors remaining shareholders rather than the withdrawer.
 * @dev The accountant quotes PAXG at its pegged price (1 PAXG = 1 XAU) in both directions. This module
 * charges a withdraw fee with two components:
 *   1. A fixed fee of FIXED_FEE_BPS basis points, charged on every withdrawal regardless of price.
 *   2. A dynamic depeg fee equal to the excess of PAXG's market value in gold over the peg, so the
 *      withdrawer is effectively paid out at max(1, marketPrice) XAU per PAXG, where marketPrice is the
 *      market PAXG:XAU rate. When PAXG trades at or below peg (marketPrice <= 1) this component is zero - the
 *      pegged valuation already
 *      favors the vault.
 * The two fees are applied sequentially, not summed on the same base: the fixed fee is taken first and the
 * dynamic depeg fee is levied only on the remainder (amount - fixedFee), so the overlap between them is not
 * double-charged. Because each fee is bounded by the base it is levied on, the total can never exceed the
 * shares offered.
 *
 * The fee is taken in shares (the offer asset). The consuming WithdrawQueue deducts it from the order's
 * offer amount before the withdraw and routes it to the fee recipient (the vault). NOTE: shares sent to
 * the vault are NOT burned by the ERC20; for these fees to actually accrue to NAV, the fee recipient and
 * the offchain NAV calculation must treat vault-held shares as nonexistent (excluded from both total
 * value and total supply). That accounting is a deployment/queue concern, out of scope for this module.
 *
 * The immutables bind the module to one vault; this module holds no admin surface. To change any of them,
 * deploy a new module and repoint the queue via setFeeModule.
