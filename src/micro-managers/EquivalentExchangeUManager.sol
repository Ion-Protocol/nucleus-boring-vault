/**
 * @title EquivalentExchangeUManager
 * @notice UManager that executes a batch of merkle-verified BoringVault actions
 *         and enforces that the aggregate value of a stored basket of tokens,
 *         measured in a common reference asset, does not decrease.
 * @dev Basket tokens are valued in a single reference asset and carried internally as 18-decimal fixed
 *      point (`NORMALIZED_DECIMALS`), where `NORMALIZED_ONE` represents one whole unit of the reference
 *      asset. Most tokens are expected to be worth one reference unit per whole token and are treated as
 *      1:1 after decimal normalization, requiring no oracle. A token may instead be flagged as
 *      oracle-priced, in which case its per-whole-token price in the reference asset is read from an
 *      `IRateProvider` at execution time and applied to its balance. The same conversion is used when
 *      paying the subsidy in an oracle-priced token.
 *
 *      Which basket tokens are oracle-priced is recorded as a bitmap (`oracleFlags`): bit `i` is set iff
 *      the basket token at index `i` (in `basketTokens` order) is oracle-priced. A basket of only 1:1
 *      tokens (such as USD stablecoins) therefore requires no oracle lookups.
 *
 *      Subsidy, if required, is pulled from an approval-based subsidy payer. The subsidy payer must
 *      pre-approve the UManager to spend the subsidy token; if the approved/available amount is
 *      insufficient, the call reverts.
 *
 *      Oracle security assumptions:
 *      - The whole basket must be denominated in a single, consistent reference asset: every 1:1 token
 *        must actually be worth one reference unit per whole token, and every oracle must return its
 *        token's price in that same reference asset. The reference asset is whatever unit the operator
 *        standardizes on -- USD, ETH, or anything else -- and is never named on-chain. Mixing units --
 *        e.g. treating USD-pegged tokens as 1:1 while an oracle returns an ETH-denominated price --
 *        compares unlike quantities and corrupts the value invariant.
 *      - Each oracle is an `IRateProvider` returning the token's whole-token price in the reference asset,
 *        scaled to the `rateDecimals` recorded for it (the contract rescales that to `NORMALIZED_DECIMALS`).
 *        The owner must record the correct `rateDecimals` -- `IRateProvider` exposes no `decimals()` to
 *        read -- and must configure oracles that return a single positive `uint256` price, perform their
 *        own staleness and sanity checks, and cannot be manipulated within a block. A raw Chainlink feed
 *        does not satisfy this (a signed tuple, no staleness guard); wrap it in an adapter such as
 *        `EthPerTokenRateProvider`.
 *      - A reverting or zero-returning oracle causes `execute` to revert, which is preferable to
 *        valuing a basket token incorrectly.
